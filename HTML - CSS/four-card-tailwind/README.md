# Frontend Mentor - Four card feature section

![Design preview for the Four card feature section coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The challenge

The challenge consists in building out this feature section and get it looking as close to the design as possible. We have used the TailwindCSS framwork in order to do it.
